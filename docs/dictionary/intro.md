# Kaitag Dictionary

*5,171 lexemes, DB 20.05.2025* {.tw-text-sm}

This work primarily draws on the speech of the villages Turaga (Irchamul region) and Shilyagi (Lower Kattagan region). The core of the lexical database is from work of Gasanova U. U. (2012), with whom we spent countless hours refining the material. Additional resources include the works of Temirbulatova S. M. (2004, 2008, 2021) and Gabibova K. M. (2009).

The dictionary is available in three formats:

* the website [Urssivar.com](https://urssivar.com/dictionary) for quick view on every device;
* the [PDF document](./xdq-eng%20dictionary.pdf) for local storage and printing;
* the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TAvQAMAw0jDdStvq2Z1E-m1mz3UWkCMGQBgLCnPQgJs/edit?usp=sharing) for data analysis and linguistic research.

There are several critical things to work on in the future. First, we need to be urgently gathering more materials. Very little is documented regarding Kaitag language and culture and the older generation is passing away. Second, we need to expand & normalize data on the existing entries. This includes providing usage examples without which the meaning is not fully expressed, and also specifying variants' villages which is crucial for research. Finally, additional time is needed for verification to correct inaccuracies and address issues with structure and orthography.

All of that requires crowdsourcing efforts. Those willing to participate can provide their contact info on the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgayq-rorEHzKEM61fvshMAFAUdhfLQyEODb67skJpaWFyAw/viewform?usp=preview) or get in touch below.

Much remains to be done — but for now, we celebrate.

## Structure

The lexemes contain *headword*, *grammatical tags*, and *definitions*. Additionally some minimal but sufficient grammatical forms are given. Also occasionally forms from different Kaitag varieties are included. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, I do not specify which particular village these forms come from.

The first tag is always a part of the speech. The grammatical forms are given depending to it:

* Nouns (*N*) have the nominal case as the headword, then the oblique case, the irregular locative form (rare), and the plural form. Sometimes the headword itself can be marked as plural (*PL*).
* Verbs (*V*) have imperfective infinitive as the headword, then perfective imperative and aorist, each of which might be absent.
* Adjectives (*ADJ*) sometimes have irregular adverbial forms, where the stress is moved at the beginning.
* Cardinal numerals (*NUM*) are given with the oblique case and the stem forms.
  
Other parts of speech include: adverbs (*ADV*), conjunction (*CONJ*), prepositions (*PREP*), postposition (*POSTP*), interjection (*INTERJ*), pronoun (*PRON*), numerals (*NUM*), copulas (*COP*), particles (*PART*), and determiners (*DET*). The latter parts in particular are not always precise.

Any word can be marked as having grammatical class (*CLS*). These words are marked with the neuter class **-б-**.

## Phonetics & Orthography

The dictionary utilizes the modern [Kaitag alphabet](#alphabet). The grapheme-phoneme correspondencies and the orthographic decisions are below.

### Consonants

<div class="table-wide">

||

|m **м**|n **н**|
|b **б**|d **д**| |||g **г**|
|pʰ **п**|tʰ **т**| |||kʰ **к**|qʰ **ҡ**|ʔ **ъ**|
|pː **пп**|tː **тт**| |||kː **кк**|qː **ҡҡ**|
|pʼ **пь**|tʼ **ть**| |||kʼ **кь**|qʼ **ҡь**
| ||tsʰ **ц**|tʃʰ **ч**|
| ||tsː **цц**|tʃː **чч**|
| ||tsʼ **ць**|tʃʼ **чь**|
|β~v/ʷ **в**| |z **з**|ʒ **ж**| ||ʁ **ғ**|
| ||s **с**|ʃ **ш**|x~ç **ҳ**| |χ **х**|h **ь**|
| ||ɾ (r)  **р**|
| |l **л**| ||j **й**|

</div>

Aspiration is not marked in the IPA transcription. There is implicit glottal stop /ʔ/ **ъ** before word-final vowels, though it is also not written anywhere. There's also rare sound /ɸ/ **ьв** occuring in only one word **ьуьв** *"blow"*. Additionally the sounds /ħ/ **хӏ** and /ʡ/ **гӏ** are displayed on a few of the Sanchi variety's forms where they have not merged into /h/ **ь** and /ʔ/ **ъ** correspondingly.

The phoneme /l/ **л** gets assimilated by adjacent /n/ **н**. To keep the orthopgahy transparent, these are not displayed: **у́ле** "eye", **уле́н-** (OBL) > **уле́нла [уленна] бира́ра** *"to jinx"*, **шин** *"water"* > **шинбе́ [шимбе]** *"waters"*. Some of the varieties lose affricate & stop gemination syllable-final positions. The gemination is restored when a vowel appears after, so it is always preserved in the orthopgraphy: **миҡ(ҡ)** *"wedding"*, **ми́ҡҡи** *"at wedding"*. Lastly, syllable-final /l/ **л** becomes palatalized when preceded by front vowels **е**, **и**: **ьел** [hɛlʲ] *"it"*, **милъя́** [milʲʔæ] *"eggs"*.

#### Geminated Fricatives

The four voiceless fricatives /s/ **с**, /ʃ/ **ш**, /x/ **ҳ**, /χ/ **х** can be geminated. The nature of this gemination (i.e. if it's phonemic) is unclear to me:

* unlike geminated affricates and stops, these vary between the villages without affecting the meaning: **атта́сса** *"by father"* (Sanchi) > **атта́са** (Shilyagi), **баҳҳа́ра** *"to walk"* > **баҳа́ра**.
* they're only audible in the intervocal position: **ччими́сси** (Shilyagi) > **ччи́мсе** (Turaga).
* the fricatives consistently geminate in plural forms formed with **-е**: **яру́с** *"Russian"*, **яру́си** *"to Russian"*, **яруссе́** *"Russians"*.

For now I chose not to display them in the orthography (**ни́са [нисса]**), but they're mostly marked in the IPA on the Google Sheet (/ˈnisːa/). This phenomenon needs to be researched.

### Vowels

|æ~aˤ **я**|

</div>

Similar to consonants, dynamic assimilations are not displayed. This mostly relates to verbs. The directional prefixes **ка-**, **ьа-**, **ца-** as well as the negation prefix **а-** become assimilated when followed by root vowels **я**, **е**: **бел** *"still is"* > **а́бел [ебел]** *"no more"*, **ц́яун** *"came"* > **а́цяун [яцяун]** *"didn't come"*, **бертта́ра** *"to rip"* > **цабертта́ра [цеберттара]** *"to tear"*, **бяҡа́ра** *"to wound"* > **ьабяҡа́ра [ьябяҡара]** *"to kick"*.

#### Stress

Stress is important and it is always marked on the headwords: **ьана́** *"currently"*, **ьа́на** *"plate"*. On declension the stress always shifts on the final syllable before any cases: **а́тта** *"father"* > **атта́-ла** *"father's"*, **бизи́** *"cat"* > **бизи́-й** *"to cat"*. However, oblique case markers are treated as final syllables for stress purposes: **чух** *"walnut"* > **чух-а́-ла** *"of walnut"*, **ляъ** *"ear"* > **ляъ-́ун-жи** *"on ear"*. Nominal plural forms always have stress on the final syllable before any cases: **кка́лкка** *"tree"* > **ккилккне́** *"trees"* > **ккилккна́-ла** *"of trees"*. Finite verb forms have it on the first syllable: **бара́ра** *"to do"* > **ба́рив** *"did"*, **чицабуца́ра** *"to put on"* > **чи́цабуца** *"put on!"*.

## Alphabet

The modern Kaitag alphabet, based on the Cyrillic alphabet, was developed in 2024. It consists of 27 letters of the Russian alphabet (Щ, Ф, Ы, Э, Ё, Ю are missing), and 3 specific characters as well as 12 specific combinations.
