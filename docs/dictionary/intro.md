# Kaitag Dictionary

*5,171 lexemes, DB 20.05.2025, doc 25.05.2025* {.tw-text-sm}

This work primarily draws on the speech of the villages **Turaga** (Irchamul region) and **Shilyagi** (Lower Kattagan region). The core of the lexical database is from work of **Gasanova U. U. (2012)**, with whom we spent countless hours refining the material. Additional resources include the works of **Temirbulatova S. M. (2004, 2008, 2021)** and **Gabibova K. M. (2009)**.

The dictionary is available in three formats:

* The website [Urssivar.com](https://urssivar.com/dictionary) for easy viewing on any device
* The [PDF document](./xdq-eng%20dictionary.pdf) for local storage and printing
* The [Google Sheet](https://forms.gle/ZrPaUdamKc2t8LE78) for data analysis and linguistic research

Plus a short commentary: ["Releasing the Kaitag Dictionary"](https://youtu.be/Ad2o1hwYagA) on YouTube.

There are several critical priorities going forward. First, we must urgently gather more material. Very little has been documented about the Kaitag language and culture, and the older generation is passing away. Second, we need to expand and normalize the existing entries. This includes adding usage examples, without which many meanings remain unclear, and specifying village variants, which is essential for deeper linguistic study. Finally, thorough verification is needed to correct inaccuracies and address inconsistencies in structure and orthography.

All of this will require crowdsourcing and collaboration. Those interested in contributing can leave their contact information via the [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgayq-rorEHzKEM61fvshMAFAUdhfLQyEODb67skJpaWFyAw/viewform?usp=preview) or get in touch directly.

## Structure

Each entry in the dictionary includes a *headword*, *grammatical tags*, and *definitions*. In many cases, minimal but sufficient grammatical forms are also provided. Occasionally, forms from different Kaitag dialects are included, although — unfortunately — I do not currently specify the exact village these variants come from.

The *first tag* is always the part of speech, and additional forms are provided accordingly:

* Nouns (*N*) list the nominative case as the headword, followed by the oblique case, the (rare) irregular locative form, and the plural form. In some cases, the headword itself may be plural (*PL*).
* Verbs (*V*) list the imperfective infinitive as the headword, followed (when available) by the perfective imperative and aorist forms.
* Adjectives (*ADJ*) may include irregular adverbial forms, typically marked by a shift of stress to the beginning of the word.
* Cardinal numerals (*NUM*) include the oblique case and stem forms.

* Nouns (*N*) have the nominal case as the headword, then the oblique case, the irregular locative form (rare), and the plural form. Sometimes the headword itself can be marked as plural (*PL*).
* Verbs (*V*) have imperfective infinitive as the headword, then perfective imperative and aorist, each of which might be absent.
* Adjectives (*ADJ*) sometimes have irregular adverbial forms, where the stress is moved at the beginning.
* Cardinal numerals (*NUM*) are given with the oblique case and the stem forms.
  
Other parts of speech include Adverbs (*ADV*), conjunctions (*CONJ*), prepositions (*PREP*), postpositions (*POSTP*), interjections (*INTERJ*), pronouns (*PRON*), copulas (*COP*), particles (*PART*), and determiners (*DET*). Some of these categories — especially the latter ones — are assigned loosely and may not reflect precise grammatical classification.

Any word may also be marked with a grammatical class (*CLS*). These are labeled with the neuter class **-б-**.

## Phonetics & Orthography

The dictionary uses the modern [Kaitag alphabet](#alphabet). Below is an overview of the grapheme-phoneme correspondences and orthographic conventions.

### Consonants

<div class="table-wide">

||

|m **м**|n **н**|
|b **б**|d **д**| |||g **г**|
|pʰ **п**|tʰ **т**| |||kʰ **к**|qʰ **ҡ**|ʔ **ъ**|
|pː **пп**|tː **тт**| |||kː **кк**|qː **ҡҡ**|
|pʼ **пь**|tʼ **ть**| |||kʼ **кь**|qʼ **ҡь**
| ||tsʰ **ц**|tʃʰ **ч**|
| ||tsː **цц**|tʃː **чч**|
| ||tsʼ **ць**|tʃʼ **чь**|
|β~v/ʷ **в**| |z **з**|ʒ **ж**| ||ʁ **ғ**|
| ||s **с**|ʃ **ш**|x~ç **ҳ**| |χ **х**|h **ь**|
| ||ɾ (r)  **р**|
| |l **л**| ||j **й**|

</div>

Aspiration is not marked in the IPA transcriptions. A glottal stop /ʔ/ **ъ** is implicitly present before word-final vowels but is not written. The rare phoneme /ɸ/ **ьв** occurs in only one word: **ьуьв** *"blow"*. Sounds such as /ħ/ **хӏ** and /ʡ/ **гӏ** appear in a few forms from the *Sanchi* variety, where they have not yet merged into /h/ **ь** and /ʔ/ **ъ**, respectively.

The phoneme /l/ л assimilates to adjacent /n/ н. To keep the orthography transparent, these assimilations are not reflected in writing. Examples:

* **у́ле** *"eye"*, **уле́н**- (OBL) > **уле́нла [уленна] бира́ра** *"to jinx"*
* **шин** *"water"* > **шинбе́ [шимбе]** *"waters"*

Some varieties lose affricate and stop gemination in syllable-final position. However, gemination is restored when followed by a vowel, so it is consistently preserved in the orthography:

* **миҡҡ [миҡ]** *"wedding"* > **ми́ҡҡи** *"at wedding"*
* **уцци́** *"brother"* > **уццбе́ [уцбе]** *"brothers"*

Syllable-final /l/ **л** becomes palatalized after front vowels **е**, **и**:

* **ьел** [hɛlʲ] *"it"*
* **милъя́** [milʲʔæ] *"eggs"*

#### Geminated Fricatives

The four voiceless fricatives /s/ **с**, /ʃ/ **ш**, /x/ **ҳ**, and /χ/ **х** can geminate, although whether this gemination is phonemic remains unclear:

1. Unlike geminated affricates and stops, their realization varies between villages without altering the meaning:

   * **атта́сса** *"by father"* (Sanchi) > **атта́са** (Shilyagi)
   * **баҳҳа́ра** *"to walk"* > **баҳа́ра**

2. It occurs only between vowels:

   * **ччими́сси** (Shilyagi) > **ччи́мсе** (Turaga)

3. It consistently appears in plural forms with **-е**:

   * **яру́с** *"Russian"* > **яруссе́** *"Russians"*, but **яру́си** *"to [a] Russian"*

For now, fricative gemination is not shown in the orthography (**ни́са [нисса]**) but is marked in the IPA in the Google Sheet ([ˈnisːa]). Further study is needed.

### Vowels

|i **и**| |u **у**|
|ɛ (e) **е**|ɐ (a) **а**|ɔ~aʷ (o) **о**|
|æ~aˤ **я**|

</div>

As with consonants, dynamic assimilations are not written. This mostly affects verbs. The directional prefixes **ка-**, **ьа-**, **ца-** and the negative prefix **а-** assimilate to **я**, **е** in root-initial syllables:

* **бел** *"still is"* > **а́бел [ебел]** *"no more"*
* **ц́яун** *"came"* > **а́цяун [яцяун]** *"didn't come"*
* **бертта́ра** *"to rip"* > **цабертта́ра [цеберттара]** *"to tear"*
* **бяҡа́ра** *"to wound"* > **ьабяҡа́ра [ьябяҡара]** *"to kick"*.

#### Stress

Stress is phonemic, strong, and always marked on headwords:

* **ьана́** *"currently"*
* **ьа́на** *"plate"*

In declension, stress shifts to the final syllable before case suffixes:

* **а́тта** *"father"* > **атта́-ла** *"father's"*
* **бизи́** *"cat"* > **бизи́-й** *"to cat"*

However, when present, oblique case markers attract the stress, functioning as the final syllable for stress assignment:

* **чух** *"walnut"* > **чух-а́-ла** *"of walnut"*
* **ляъ** *"ear"* > **ляъ-́ун-жи** *"on ear"*

Plural forms have final-syllable stress before case suffixes:

* **кка́лкка** *"tree"* > **ккилккне́** *"trees"* > **ккилккна́-ла** *"of trees"*

In finite verbs, stress falls on the first syllable:

* **бара́ра** *"to do"* > **ба́рив** *"did"*
* **чицабуца́ра** *"to put on"* > **чи́цабуца** *"put on!"*

## Alphabet

The modern Kaitag alphabet, developed in 2024 and based on Cyrillic, consists of 27 letters from the Russian script (excluding Щ, Ф, Ы, Э, Ё, and Ю), along with 3 unique characters and 12 specific digraphs.
